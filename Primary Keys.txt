A primary key is unique to each row in a relation. It uniquely identifies
a row.

You can't have duplicate records with the same primary key. 

                                        Table "public.person"
      Column      |         Type          | Collation | Nullable |              Default               
------------------+-----------------------+-----------+----------+------------------------------------
 id               | bigint                |           | not null | nextval('person_id_seq'::regclass)
 first_name       | character varying(50) |           | not null | 
 last_name        | character varying(50) |           | not null | 
 gender           | character varying(50) |           | not null | 
 email            | character varying(50) |           |          | 
 date_of_birth    | date                  |           | not null | 
 country_of_birth | character varying(50) |           | not null | 
Indexes:
    "person_pkey" PRIMARY KEY, btree (id)


IN this example, the id is the primary key. And the constraint is:

"person_pkey", and we can drop it:

ALTER TABLE person DROP CONSTRAINT "person_pkey"

We can add PRIMARY KEYS with the commande below:

 ALTER TABLE person ADD PRIMARY KEY (id);
