Today was learning how to create a database and becoming familiar with
the bash shell:


LESSON 1 -- Database creation

-# CREATE DATABASE [databasename];

psql -h [localhost | remote ip address] -p 5432 -U [username] [databasename]]
Connection options:
  -h, --host=HOSTNAME      database server host or socket directory (default: "local socket")
  -p, --port=PORT          database server port (default: "5432")
  -U, --username=USERNAME  database user name (default: "naodyimam")
  -w, --no-password        never prompt for password
  -W, --password           force password prompt (should happen automatically)


  Some common options:

  \l -- list databases
  \c -- change to other database 
  \q -- quit

  Lesson 2  -- Creating a Table

  CREATE TABLE table_name {
    Column name + data type + constraints, 
    etc,
    etc
  }

Here is what it looks like with a real table, but there 
aren't any constraints. Constraints are necessary to ensure
the completeness and integrity of the data.

test=# CREATE TABLE person (
test(# id INT,
test(# first_name VARCHAR(50),
test(# last_name VARCHAR(50),
test(# gender VARCHAR(7),
test(# date_of_birth DATE);

Using NOT NULL as a constraint makes sure that the column in the table must
be filled in.

BIGSERIAL as a data time lets the items automatically be ordered
so the id column would be incremented by one.

After the table is created, you can view the relation in detail with the command:

\d [tablename]
